# example

This example demonstrates the use of the `CellExtension` annotation to extend `ValueCell` and
`MutableCell` with accessors for the properties of the `Person` class declared in the `main.dart`
file.

To try out this example, you'll need to run the following command:

```shell
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
